    "text": "This is a post with executable code.\nThe data is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/healthcare-insurance/data\nThe code demonstrates that health insurance expenditures increase as age increases. This is true for smokers and non smokers. Each additional year of age increases the health expenditure.\nHowever, the difference between smoking and non smoking is pronounced. While the scatterplot shows that some individual smokers have lower healthcare costs than some individual nonsmokers, overall the average expenditure is much, much higher for smokers. It is so much higher that the average 20 year old smoker has more healthcare expenditure than the average 60 year old nonsmoker.\nThis dataset illustrates the massive negative impacts of smoking on health via the monetary impact of health insurance spending.\n\n# load in the data\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"data/insurance 2.csv\")\nhead(data)\n\n  age    sex    bmi children smoker    region   charges\n1  19 female 27.900        0    yes southwest 16884.924\n2  18   male 33.770        1     no southeast  1725.552\n3  28   male 33.000        3     no southeast  4449.462\n4  33   male 22.705        0     no northwest 21984.471\n5  32   male 28.880        0     no northwest  3866.855\n6  31 female 25.740        0     no southeast  3756.622\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# scatterplot by age and healthcare expenditure\n# two linear regression lines by smoking status\nggplot(data, aes(x = age, y = charges, color = smoker)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Regression of Charges vs. Age by Smoking Status\",\n       x = \"Age\",\n       y = \"Charges\",\n       color = \"Smoker\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'"

    "text": "This is a post with executable code.\nThe data is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/gym-members-exercise-dataset/data\nThe dataset shows that individuals that do Cardio and Yoga have slightly lower resting heart rates compared to those that do HIIT and Strength training. This could be due to the calming effects of Yoga, and the aerobic conditioning effects of cardio.\nThe maximum heart rate achieved was lowest for strength, followed by cardio, then HIIT, with the highest being for Yoga. This surprised me, since I would’ve assumed that cardio and HIIT would have the highest maximum heart rate. It is possible that yoga involves a small burst of activity that raises the heart rate to a higher maximum compared to cardio which may be more consistent, or that people choosing to do Yoga have different underlying characteristics.\nHowever, the overall differences between groups were small.\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"data/gym_data.csv\")\nhead(data)\n\n  Age Gender Weight..kg.
