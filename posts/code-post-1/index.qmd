This is a post with executable code.

The data is from <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/gym-members-exercise-dataset/data>

```{r}
data <- read.csv("data/gym_data.csv")
head(data)

library(dplyr)

# average resting heart rate by workout type
summary <- data %>%
  group_by(Workout_Type) %>%
  summarize(Resting_BPM = mean(Resting_BPM, na.rm = TRUE))

print(summary)

# max heart rate by workout type
summary <- data %>%
  group_by(Workout_Type) %>%
  summarize(Max_BPM = mean(Max_BPM, na.rm = TRUE))

print(summary)

library(ggplot2)

#box plots of maximum bpm by working type
ggplot(data, aes(x = Workout_Type, y = Max_BPM, fill = Workout_Type)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Max_BPM by Workout_Type", 
       x = "Exercise Type", 
       y = "Max BPM") +
  theme_minimal()
