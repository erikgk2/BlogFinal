Hello!

I am a student in UIUC's MSLIS program. I currently work in a public library but hope to work in an academic library after I graduate. I am interested in data focused librarianship paths, such as eventually becoming a GIS Librarian or fulfilling a similar role.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my two dogs, as well as bouldering. When it's nice out, I like to do a little bit of gardening, but these days I'm not doing much of that!
